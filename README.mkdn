# Highrise (3.0.0)

## What is it?

This gem provides a set of classes to access information on [Highrise][h] via the published [API][api]:

    Account, Comment, Company, Deal, DealCategory, Email, Group, Case, Membership, Note, Person, Subject, Tag, Task, TaskCategory and User.

All these classes are inherited from ActiveResouce::Base. Refer to the [ActiveResouce][ar] documentation for more information.

## Installing

    gem install highrise

### Dependencies (see <code>highrise.gemspec</code> or run <code>bundle check</code>)

### Documentation

  I'm on [rdoc.info][rdoc] and here're some [metrics][caliper]

### Configure your key
    
    require 'highrise'
    
    Highrise::Base.site = 'http://your_site.highrisehq.com'
    Highrise::Base.user = 'api-auth-token'

If you are using this in a Rails application, putting this code in a config/initializers/highrise.rb
file is recommended. See config_initializers_highrise.rb in the examples/ directory.

## Usage

    @tags = Highrise::Tag.find(:all)
    
    @people = Highrise::Person.find_all_across_pages(:params => {:tag_id => 12345})
    
    @person.tag!("VIP")
